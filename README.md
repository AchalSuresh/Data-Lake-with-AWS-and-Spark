# Data Lake Spark

***

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

## Overview

***

Project builds an ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) to create the DB and tables in S3, fetches data from JSON files stored in AWS S3, process the data, and insert the data to Amazon S3 using Spark..

### Technologies Used:

	* Python 3
	* Apache Spark for modeling
	* AWS S3 for storing and building data



## Datasets

***

The dataset consists of 2 datasets residing in S3 bucket in the following directory

    Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
    Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings. The file looks like this:

## Part I Data Modeling using Apache Cassandra
Using the song and log datasets, a star schema is implemented optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.


### Fact Table
**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables
**users** - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

**songs** - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

**artists** - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Part III ETL Pipeline for Moving the files from S3 bucket to S3 using Spark

The ETL pipeline to load data from S3 to analytics tables on another S3 location to create data lake

    * etl.py: Load data from S3 into datalake at another s3 location using Spark.
    
## How to Run:

***

	1. Update the dwh.cfg file with AWS Key and Secret for the User details
	1. Create a folder in your S3 location and update the value in dl.cfg file
	1. Run the etl.py to load the data after processing to the new S3 location
